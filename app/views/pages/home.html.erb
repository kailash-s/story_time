                        With so many hindrances and unanswered questions we are facing daily,
                        questions and fear regarding our children’s learning progress shouldn’t be
                        one of them. That is why I have taken the initiative in delivering age
                        appropriate education, in the most fun-nest ways, to your little ones at the
                        comfort of your own home.<br><br> I cannot promise what our economy has for us 5
                        weeks from now but I can say with confidence that your children will be
                        exploring, engaging and getting a head start at learning when our nation is
                        ready to end lock down.
